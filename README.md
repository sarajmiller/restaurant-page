## Project Description

Welcome to Sara's Cottage ~ This is a fun little project I made while following [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page)'s JavaScript Course. The purpose of this project was to practice DOM manipulation by dynamically rendering a restaurant homepage. I got a lot of practice with configuring Webpack to bundle JavaScript modules as well as handle non-JavaScript files. I also got a lot of practice just using JavaScript to render elements. And of course, my favorite part was adding the Minecraft cherry forest theme!

You can check out my restaurant page [here](https://sarajmiller.github.io/restaurant-page/). Note that I have not developed this page for mobile.

## Sources

I used a few sources to make my website look nice.
* The font I used is [*Monocraft*](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft). I absolutely love this font and the nostalgic feel it gives off.
* I got the background image from [chillcrafting](https://chillcrafting.tumblr.com/post/627810185741844480) on Tumblr. I love the soft atmosphere it adds to the page.
* Finally, for the menu item images, I found this image pack from [Okami Squadron](https://www.okamisquadron.com/downloads/1-21-images#h.61z1hsbuaaw) that has pngs for pretty much every minecraft item in the game. Very cool.

## Future Developments

In terms of future developments, I pretty much achieved my goal of this project which was to learn the basics of Webpack and DOM manipulation. However, there are a few features I could add sometime in the future.

* **Enchantment Effects**: When an item is enchanted in Minecraft, it has a purple glowing animation. It would be really cool to learn how to add this to elements here and in my future projects.
* **Custom Cursor**: Later on, I want to look into creating a custom cursor that looks really nice.
* **Mobile Development**: I probably won't develop this webpage for mobile because this project was just for practice, but that is something I could add later for better visibility on different devices.
